                <h3>German Shepherd</h3>

                <p>
                    Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, 
                    the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of 
                    noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, 
                    courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog 
                    lover's delight.German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches 
                    at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of 
                    smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a 
                    free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach 
                    great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the 
                    front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute 
                    is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands 
                    for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in 
                    defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and 
                    steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain 
                    aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate 
                    friendships.'

            <!--Siberian Husky-->
            <div id="husky">
                <h3>Siberian Husky</h3>
                <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1489924034176-2e678c29d4c6?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=751&q=80" alt=""/>
                <p>
                    Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and 
                    great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at
                    moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. Sibes are friendly, fastidious, 
                    and dignified.The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped eyes 
                    can be either brown or blue'and sometimes one of each'and convey a keen but 
                    amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians 
                    are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales 
                    at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their 
                    burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. As born pack dogs, they enjoy family life 
                    and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness render them 
                    indifferent watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can't resist chasing small 
                    animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: 
                    Sibes are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.

                <h3>Golden Retriever</h3>
                <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611250282006-4484dd3fba6b?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80" alt="golden retriever">
                <p>
                    The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among
                    America's most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field 
                    work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other 
                    competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.
                    The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, 
                    lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly 
                    and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, 
                    Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed 
                    fanciers say, with a 'merry action.' The most complete records of the development of 
                    the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until 
                    about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord 
                    Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice 
                    in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, 
                    historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. 
                    They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through 
                    generations. Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and 
                    relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain 
                    this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor 
                    play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are 
                    natural pastimes.
