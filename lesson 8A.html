                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey everyone, PuffballsUnited here! 
                    It’s been a very exciting time for us the past few months! 
                    We’ve absolutely loved seeing everyone enjoying Among Us! 
                    Forte has been working hard to get the servers adjusted to 
                    deal with the huge influx of players. Thank you so much for 
                    bearing with us through these growing pains. Hopefully we can 
                    get started on new content soon! Speaking of new content…
                </p>
                <h2></h2>
                <p>
                    Us devs have had several long discussions about what we want 
                    to do with the game. When do we stop working on Among Us 1? 
                    What content goes into Among Us 2? The main reason we are shooting 
                    for a sequel is because the codebase of Among Us 1 is so outdated 
                    and not built to support adding so much new content. However, 
                    seeing how many people are enjoying Among Us 1 really makes us 
                    want to be able to support the game and take it to the next level. 
                    We have decided to cancel Among Us 2 and instead put all our focus 
                    into improving Among Us 1. All of the content we had planned for 
                    Among Us 2 will instead go into Among Us 1. This is probably the 
                    more difficult choice because it means going deep into the core 
                    code of the game and reworking several parts of it. We have lots 
                    of things planned and we’re excited to bring new content to everyone 
                    as you continue to enjoy playing!

                <h2>Highlights</h2>
                <p>Here’s some things that are coming on the horizon</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span>Servers</span><br>
                        Forte is still working very hard to figure out our 
                        server issues. We don’t have an ETA but things should 
                        hopefully be getting better and better. This is taking
                         up all development time on his end
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <span>Colorblind support</span><br>
                        It’s something we’ve put off for way too long… 
                        We plan on adding other identifiers for players as 
                        well as certain color focused tasks (Like wires). 
                        This should also open the potential for more colors. 
                        In the past we couldn’t add more colors because it 
                        became too difficult to tell players apart.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <span>Friends/Account System</span><br>
                        This is something we’ve wanted to do for a long time 
                        but just haven’t been able to tackle. For the health 
                        of the game going forward we’re going to sink our 
                        teeth in and figure it out! This one will definitely 
                        take some time
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <span>A new stage</span><br>
                        It is still very early and we have only just begun 
                        designing the layout. The theme has been settled on though! 
                        The next stage in Among Us is going to be a Henry Stickmin 
                        themed location!
                    </li>
